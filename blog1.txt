Trishneet Arora was born in a middle-class family and her father worked as a tax consultant in Ludhiana. And his mother was a homemaker and he had an elder brother â€“ Avneet Sing Arora. Trishneet did not feel like studying since childhood, his interest in computer was so much that he used to spend the whole day running the computer and could not pay attention to his studies, due to which he failed in 8th class. His mother and father scolded him greatly because of his attachment to computers and his failure in 8th class. Due to which he had left his study and put all his attention on the computer and did not lose sight of his goal at all.
And he went deeper into the world of computers.
The tale began a decade ago when 11 year old Trishneet got his first computer. Soon he started to experiment with it and in turn learned all about computer hardware. As a result of his computer fanaticism he failed in the class VIII examination and completed his class X through open learning.
After some time people started knowing his work.
And today at the age of just 22, I had formed a company named TAC.
And today his company Reliance is providing cyber-related facilities to Gujarat Police and CBI.
And today the whole world is saluting her success, because Trishneet, with her hard work, at such a young age, has done what very few people are able to do. And today at the age of just 28, I have made a company worth crores.

Trishneet's journey from a middle-class child to a successful young adult is very extraordinary and inspirational.
